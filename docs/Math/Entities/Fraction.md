# Fraction

Sometimes it is more convenient to use Fractions instead of real numbers. Calculations with native fractions has lots of advantages since enumerator and denominator are stored separatedly.

Namespace and dependencies:
```php
namespace irrevion\science\Math\Entities;

use irrevion\science\Helpers\Delegator;
use irrevion\science\Math\Math;

class Fraction extends Scalar implements Entity {}
